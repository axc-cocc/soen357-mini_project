            Managing chronic health conditions is a complex process and can be very demanding on a person. It's a process that
            requires a lot of time, effort, effective medication tracking, and appointment scheduling. This case study explores 
            the UX/UI strategy for a mobile application designed with the goal of helping individuals with chronic conditions
            manage their health more effectively. Each of these methods of gathering data have benefits, but also present certain 
            drawbacks, making a combined approach of implementing each method most effective for the development of the application.

                To ensure the application is designed with the user in mind, it is important employ proper user reasearch techniques.
                Understanding the needs of the patients will help a seemless and effective user experience. The methods I would use for
                this case study incluse interviews with individuals with chronic conditions and healthcare professionals, surveys, and analyzing
                UX studies on similar applications.

                Interviews are effective tool in gathering data as they allow for a more personal and in-depth understanding of the 
                individuals being interviewed. These conversations can reveal workflow challenges, and specific feature requests. However,
                interviews can be time consuming and may not always be representative of the entire user base. They can also present some personal 
                biases and may not always be reliable. To remedy the biases, I would structure the questions in a way that is open-ended and allows 
                room for an organic discussion.
            </p>
            <p>
                Surveys are another excellent tool for gathering a large amount of data, allowing for broad insights into user needs needs and preferences 
                for the application.However, they can present certain drawbacks. Participants of the survey can provide incomplete answers or dishonest answers 
                which can be due to a multitude of reasons. Furthermore, a bad design of the survey questions can lead to unusable date. To mitigate these issues,
                I would ensure the survey is well designed and the questions are clear and concise.

            <p>
                Given this, the best course action would be to implement a combined approach of all three methods. This would allow for a more comprehensive application 
                and ensure a well-rounded unsderstand of individual needs and create a chronic health care application that is functional, but also meets the requirments
                of users.
